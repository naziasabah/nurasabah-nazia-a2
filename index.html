        <h3>Summer Style</h3>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a1576/50-famous-fashion-quotes/"><em><q>"Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live."</q></em></blockquote>

        <p>Yello there! It’s been a beautiful few days here in Boston, suited for a sunny maxi like this one. I’ve always loved long dresses as they make for quick “one and done” outfits that can often be dressed up or down. For flattering petite-friendly options, Banana Republic has been so good lately! I’m partnering with them again to share this dress that is versatile for summer travels, and can also be styled for special occasions like a wedding.They are launching this <strong>June 24 <sup>th</sup>, 2019</strong> on their website.</p>

        <p>A little while ago on my Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/n_zia13/">@n_zia13</a>, I talked a bit about the reason I started incorporating more colour into my wardrobe (or rather, why I didn't wear as much before). In short, growing up, I really truly didn't think that bright colours were meant to be worn by girls with darker/brown skin. A load of bullsh*t, if you ask me. My best friend called me out for it one day saying, <q>If you come back with anything grey, black, or white, I'm not talking to you.</q></p>

        <p>Last month while visiting family in CA, I was particularly excited to check out the Carlsbad flower fields as a break between our drive! These fields are usually in bloom March through early May, so they’re gone already for 2019, but mark your calendars for next year if you’re in the area (p.s. the Carlsbad outlet mall including a Theory outlet is right around the corner)!</p>

        <p>I almost didn’t try on this floral tiered maxi dress since the stock photo isn’t too exciting to me online. But upon zipping it up, it surprised me – it just feels so feminine and floaty and fit comfortably all around.</p>

        <p>Other features I love include a chiffon-like fabric (non stretch) that is pretty wrinkle resistant (great for vacation packing), a full lining, a nursing friendly top, and a small clasp in the front to secure a modest neckline. The solid 5 star reviews online (check reviews under both Petite and Regular sizing) also echo my sentiments about the dress exceeding expectations!</p>
